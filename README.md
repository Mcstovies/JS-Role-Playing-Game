Dragon Hunter RPG

Welcome to Dragon Hunter, a text-based role-playing game (RPG) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the hero of the game, your mission is to save the town by defeating a fearsome dragon blocking everyone's escape. Along the way, you'll navigate through various locations, purchase items, fight monsters, and gather gold and experience.

This project showcases skills in front-end development, logic-based gameplay design, and the ability to craft an interactive user experience using JavaScript.
Features

    Interactive Gameplay: Navigate through locations like the town square, store, and cave.
    Combat System: Fight monsters such as slimes, fanged beasts, and the ultimate dragon.
    Inventory Management: Collect weapons with increasing power and manage your inventory strategically.
    Progression Mechanics: Gain experience points (XP), collect gold, and upgrade your character's stats.
    Randomized Events: Includes an "Easter Egg" mini-game with randomized outcomes.
    Responsive Feedback: Displays dynamic stats (XP, health, gold) and game messages to keep players informed.

Technologies Used

    HTML: Structures the game interface and layout.
    CSS: Adds a styled theme with colors, gradients, and spacing for a polished appearance.
    JavaScript: Handles the core gameplay logic, player interactions, and dynamic UI updates.
